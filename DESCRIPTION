Description: Given a set of models for which a measure of model (mis)fit and model complexity is provided, CHull(), developed by Ceulemans and Kiers (2006) <doi:10.1348/000711005X64817>, determines the models that are located on the boundary of the convex hull and selects an optimal model by means of the scree test values.
